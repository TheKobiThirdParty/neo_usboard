# ROS-Node for Neobotix USBoard

This node handles parameters and communication of the Neobotix USBoard.
The USBoard is available as standalone unit and in all Neobotix mobile robots (http://www.neobotix-robots.com/components.html).

## Neobotix USBoard features

* Users can connect up to 16 Bosch ParkPilot URF6 / USS4 ultrasonic sensors to the USBoard and read their measurements via CAN and RS232. This allows to easily fill gaps that cannot be covered by other sensors.
* In standalone mode two thresholds (warning and alarm) can be defined for each sensor individually. Two relays signal the detection of an obstacle within the warning or alarm range of any active sensor.
* Configuration of the Neobotix USBoard is done via an easy to use graphical user interface that is included in delivery. The user interface runs on any Java capable computer with an RS232 port and makes configuration and monitoring fast and convenient.
* For more information please take a look at the datasheet: http://www.neobotix-robots.com/fileadmin/files/downloads/Datenblaetter/USBoard-Datenblatt.pdf

## Distributors
Neobotix USBoard and accessories are available at:

* Neobotix GmbH (http://www.neobotix-robots.com)
* Customers in the U.S. please contact our local distributor AutonomouStuff (http://autonomoustuff.com/product/ultrasonic/).

## Versions

Tested with:
* ROS Indigo on Ubuntu 14.04
* ROS Kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04

## Installation

1. Clone the repository into your catkin workspace src folder ($ git clone https://github.com/neobotix/neo_usboard.git)
2. Clone neo_msgs into your catkin workspace src folder ($ git clone https://github.com/neobotix/neo_msgs.git)
3. Check the ttyUSB port on which the USBoard is connected to the PC via RS-232 (generally /dev/ttyUSB0)
4. Define parameters in launch/usboard_param.yaml 
5. Make sure that neo_msgs package is added to your catkin workspace
6. Build your catkin workspace
7. Run the neo_usboard roslaunch file ( $ roslaunch neo_usboard neo_usboard.launch)
8. 

## Usage

1. Configure the USBoard: neo_usboard/launch/usboard_param.yaml
2. Start the Node: ```roslaunch neo_usboard neo_usboard.launch ```
3. Print and montior the published sensors data using rostopic or rqt: ```rostopic echo /USBoard/Measurements```
