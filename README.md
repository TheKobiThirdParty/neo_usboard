* Users can connect up to 16 Bosch ParkPilot URF6 / USS4 ultrasonic sensors to the USBoard and read their measurements via CAN and RS232. This allows to easily fill gaps that cannot be covered by other sensors.
* In standalone mode two thresholds (warning and alarm) can be defined for each sensor individually. Two relays signal the detection of an obstacle within the warning or alarm range of any active sensor.
* Configuration of the Neobotix USBoard is done via an easy to use graphical user interface that is included in delivery. The user interface runs on any Java capable computer with an RS232 port and makes configuration and monitoring fast and convenient.
* For more information please take a look at the datasheet: http://www.neobotix-robots.com/fileadmin/files/downloads/Datenblaetter/USBoard-Datenblatt.pdf
